The software provides a visual representation of the complexity metrics, allowing developers to easily identify and understand complex sections of code. It also suggests refactoring techniques and provides recommendations for simplifying and optimizing the code. Please design and implement it based on the following requirements:\n1. Implement code input interface allowing users to paste or upload code snippets, supporting multiple programming languages with syntax highlighting\n2. Calculate and display cyclomatic complexity metrics for each function/method in the code, highlighting sections that exceed defined thresholds (e.g., complexity > 10)\n3. Analyze and visualize nesting depth of code blocks, marking areas where nesting exceeds 3 levels\n4. Detect and highlight duplicate code segments, showing similarity percentage and locations of duplicated blocks\n5.
